##Summary for Grokking Algorithms And Solves Exercise and also contain Examples from the book.
##Chapter 1:
Binary Search:
-Algorithm: Divide the array into two parts and check the middle element of the array and compare it with the target
if it is equal to the target then return the index of the element 
if the target is greater than the middle element then search in the right half of the array
if the target is less than the middle element then search in the left half of the array
If the target is not found then return -1.
-Time Complexity: O(log n).
-Space Complexity: O(1).
